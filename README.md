# Chirpy Starter [![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/jekyll-theme-chirpy)](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-theme-chirpy) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/cotes2020/chirpy-starter.svg?color=blue)][mit]

When installing the [**Chirpy**][chirpy] theme through [RubyGems.org][gem], Jekyll can only read files in the folders `/_data`, `/_layouts`, `/_includes`, `/_sass` and `/assets`, as well as a small part of options of the `/_config.yml` file from the theme's gem. If you have ever installed this theme gem, you can use the command `bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy` to locate these files.

The Jekyll team claims that this is to leave the ball in the user’s court, but this also results in users not being able to enjoy the out-of-the-box experience when using feature-rich themes.

To fully use all the features of **Chirpy**, you need to copy the other critical files from the theme's gem to your Jekyll site. The following is a list of targets:

```shell
.
├── _config.yml
├── _plugins
├── _tabs
└── index.html
```

To save you time, and also in case you lose some files while copying, we extract those files/configurations of the latest version of the **Chirpy** theme and the [CD][CD] workflow to here, so that you can start writing in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Follow the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of the basic environment. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) also needs to be installed.

## Installation

Sign in to GitHub and [**use this template**][use-template] to generate a brand new repository and name it `USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` represents your GitHub username.

Then clone it to your local machine and run:

```
$ bundle
```

## Usage

Please see the [theme's docs](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#documentation).

=======
A Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is © 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.

I think I've got things running smoothly and fixed some major bugs, but feel free to file issues or make pull requests if you want to improve the generic template / theme.

### Note: if you are using this repo and now get a notification about a security vulnerability, delete the Gemfile.lock file. 

# Instructions

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
1. (Optional) Use the Jupyter notebooks or python scripts in the `markdown_generator` folder to generate markdown files for publications and talks from a TSV file.

See more info at https://academicpages.github.io/

## To run locally (not on GitHub Pages, to serve on your own computer)

1. Clone the repository and made updates as detailed above
1. Make sure you have ruby-dev, bundler, and nodejs installed: `sudo apt install ruby-dev ruby-bundler nodejs`
1. Run `bundle clean` to clean up the directory (no need to run `--force`)
1. Run `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies. If you get errors, delete Gemfile.lock and try again.
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll liveserve` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change.

# Changelog -- bugfixes and enhancements

There is one logistical issue with a ready-to-fork template theme like academic pages that makes it a little tricky to get bug fixes and updates to the core theme. If you fork this repository, customize it, then pull again, you'll probably get merge conflicts. If you want to save your various .yml configuration files and markdown files, you can delete the repository and fork it again. Or you can manually patch. 

To support this, all changes to the underlying code appear as a closed issue with the tag 'code change' -- get the list [here](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aclosed%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22code%20change%22%20). Each issue thread includes a comment linking to the single commit or a diff across multiple commits, so those with forked repositories can easily identify what they need to patch.
